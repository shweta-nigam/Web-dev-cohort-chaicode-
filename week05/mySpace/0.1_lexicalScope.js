/*Note:-  Lexical scope in JS
üé≠ Act 1: The Rule of Lexical Scope
Lexical scope means ‚Äúwhere a variable is written in the code determines where it can be accessed.‚Äù

Inner functions can access variables from outer functions.
Outer functions CANNOT access variables from inner functions.

"Lexical" refers to where the function is physically written in the code. JavaScript remembers where a function was created, and it follows that hierarchy when looking for variables.

Lexical means "by location in the code". The scope of a function is determined by where it's written, NOT where it's called.

let fName = "Shweta"

let userName = "Alice"

    return function(){
        return `User name is: ${userName} ${lastName}`       // username will be John because of the Function Execution context , it is also the reason we can declare the username inside function also, but still access the userName of Global Execution context in the absence of the userName inside function.
    }

console.log(userDetail()())
// userDetail()()            here this wont work
